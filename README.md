# Psychic-Game

For this assignment I had a lot of fun manipulating arrays by storing user keystrokes. To win the game, user has a limited amount of guesses from a-z. For each letter guessed correctly, the user is awared a point and once all the guesses are exhausted, the user loses. I finished early on this assignment and decided to add a header with a youtube link to a visual. I learned a lot trying to put the video in the foreground and even put in google fonts to make game a arcade feel. Some of the challenges were logging the user key strokes and setting variables to them. It took me a while to figure out how to store the information of the user.
